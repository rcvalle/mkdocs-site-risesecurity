- description: This project contains a set of assembly components for proof of concept
    codes (i.e., "shellcodes") for different operating systems and architectures.
    These components were carefully designed and implemented for maximum reliability,
    following strict coding standards and requirements, such as system call invocation
    standards, position-independent, register-independent and zero-free code. A special
    attention was put on code length when designing and implementing them, resulting
    in the most reliable and shortest codes for such purpose available today.
