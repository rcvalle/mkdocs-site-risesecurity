# Exploiting Linux sock_sendpage() NULL Pointer Dereference on Power

We wrote [an exploit][1] for the [Linux kernel sock_sendpage NULL pointer
dereference vulnerability][2], discovered by Tavis Ormandy and Julien Tinnes,
to demonstrate the exploitability of this vulnerability on Linux running on
Power/Cell BE architecture -based processors.

The exploit uses the SELinux policy and the mmap_min_addr protection issue
(CVE-2009-2695) to exploit this vulnerability on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3
and CentOS 5.3. The problem, first noticed by Brad Spengler, was described by
Red Hat in the Red Hat Knowledgebase article: [Security-Enhanced Linux
(SELinux) policy and the mmap_min_addr protection (CVE-2009-2695)][3]

We added support for i386 and x86_64 for completeness. For a more complete
implementation, see [Brad Spengler's exploit][4], which also uses the
[personality trick][5] published by Tavis Ormandy and Julien Tinnes.

Linux kernel versions from 2.4.4 to 2.4.37.4, and from 2.6.0 to 2.6.30.4 are
vulnerable.

kernel versions:

* openSUSE 11.1 (2.6.27.7-9)

It was also tested and does not work on these distributions and their
respective kernel versions (i.e., the vulnerability was fixed):

* CentOS 5.3 (2.6.18-128.7.1.el5)
* CentOS 4.8 (2.6.9-89.0.9.EL)
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3 (2.6.18-128.7.1.el5)

* Ubuntu 8.10 (2.6.27-14)
* openSUSE 11.1 (2.6.27.29-0.1)

The exploit may also work on earlier versions of these and other distributions.
